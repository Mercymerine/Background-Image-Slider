# New Things Learned or Refreshed
I realized how easy it was to make a slider project without the use of jQuery.

# Biggest Take Away(s)
Image sliders aren't a jQuery thing. All I had to do was access different images from inside of an array. And to make accessing each image easier, I just needed to make sure images had the same name but different numbers so they can be accessed by an index.
